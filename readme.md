## ScuolaCloud project

ScuolaCloud is a school management platform created specifically for my school (ITIS Vittorio Veneto) as my graduation project.

Since I got the idea to do this 3 weeks before the final exams I couldn't dedicate as much time as I wanted;  there are many functions that are not 
yet implemented and some things could have been done in a better way.

Unfortunately, this project is not actively maintained and it might contain bugs living inside of it.
